65,condition1,23,Non-Hispanic,If the sentence made sense ,Female,White,
67,condition1,32,Non-Hispanic,I just went with my initial instinct. I don't have any additional questions.,Male,White,
75,condition1,47,Non-Hispanic,"No questions.  It's odd how some of these statements just didn't sound right.  And I just went by what sounded illogical.  Something could affect something in such that it caused it or enabled it.  But if something enabled something to happen then it can't be the cause, by definition it would just be a contributing factor helping it to happen rather than causing.  Thinking along those lines.",Male,White,
64,condition1,24,Non-Hispanic,,Female,Asian,
86,condition1,43,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
100,condition1,62,Non-Hispanic,"There sometimes were subtle differences between the terms, but other times it was more clear-cut. The terms ""enabled"" and ""affected"" (especially the former one) seemed to be primary in my deciding whether a sentence sounded right.",Female,White,
61,condition1,34,Non-Hispanic,"One question - was this actually a backdoor survey to measure public perception of the Sackler family? Weirdly specific in the repeated questions, lol.",Male,White,
97,condition1,27,Hispanic,"Maybe inanimate vs animate actors? I guess that would play a part in determining which words are acceptable.

I think the sentence structure would have greatly benefited from additional punctuation since it was two separate clauses. It was kind of irritating me while reading it.

Example: The dry weather enabled the wildfire; in fact, it caused it.",Male,Asian,
73,condition1,50,Non-Hispanic,No factors influenced how I responded.,Female,White,
93,condition1,62,Non-Hispanic,"The factors are as follows.  I had to decide if the sentence made sense. Also, I had to decide if the sentence seemed natural to me.

This was an interesting experiment!",Male,White,
101,condition1,32,Hispanic,The grammar in each sentence and if it made sense according to the sentence.,Female,American Indian/Alaska Native,
102,condition1,21,Non-Hispanic,If it sounded correct when I read it in my head,Male,Black/African American,
69,condition1,37,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
94,condition1,26,Non-Hispanic,no comment,Male,Black/African American,
68,condition1,21,Non-Hispanic,"Whenever a statement like this says ""X influenced Y, in fact it caused Y"" it has to go from weaker to stronger. Caused is the end all be all. If you caused something you didn't just enable it, you made Y occur.",Non-binary,White,
82,condition1,30,Non-Hispanic,The way it came out when I would say it or how I read it.,Male,Asian,
95,condition1,44,Non-Hispanic,"Factors that determined my response would be if the sentence made sense. I don't think any with the (,)and combined sentence make much sense though.",Female,White,
71,condition1,27,Non-Hispanic,I feel a sentence flows better when 'affect' comes before 'cause',Female,Asian,
59,condition1,23,Non-Hispanic,Just thinking about if it would be weird to say that sentence out loud or not,Female,White,
111,condition1,21,Non-Hispanic,factors: whether the sentence could be used properly in a conversation or if it did not make any sense and could no longer be used in a conversation,Female,White,
91,condition1,24,Non-Hispanic,"Word order, or sound of the sentence",Male,White,
66,condition1,26,Non-Hispanic,I read it aloud to see if the sentences sounded natural and if it flowed well.,Male,Asian,
85,condition1,22,Non-Hispanic,,Male,White,
62,condition1,21,Non-Hispanic,"Some things sound better in a specific  order. Also, the more time this took, the more I realized I don't truly know the meaning of these words to the extent I thought. ",Female,White,
109,condition1,26,Non-Hispanic,How the sentence sounded to me in my head influenced how I responded. ,Male,White,
99,condition1,31,Non-Hispanic,I responded based on how the sentence sounded to me. I have no additional comments. ,Male,White,
105,condition1,52,Non-Hispanic,whether it sounded right spoken.,Female,White,
76,condition1,23,Non-Hispanic,"Part of it was just if it sounded right, but also it was thinking about the meaning of the word, like if it caused it, that's kind of an end all be all, so if you already said it was the reason for something, saying it enabled or affected it is in a sense redundant.Whereas if you say something affected something and then add detail by saying it caused it or enabled it, you are explaining the degree it affected/the direction it affected.",Female,White,
87,condition1,21,Non-Hispanic,im not an english major idk,Male,White,
104,condition1,40,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
89,condition1,43,Non-Hispanic,relationships of the words and which ones came before or after,Male,White,
110,condition1,42,Non-Hispanic,I tried to imagine each key word occupying a certain place in the sentence. I also tried to imagine the single sentence as two sentences.,Male,other_race,
63,condition1,23,Non-Hispanic,,Female,White,
113,condition1,43,Non-Hispanic,I just decided if it made sense in context.,Female,White,

92,condition1,24,Non-Hispanic,,Male,Asian,
81,condition1,46,Non-Hispanic,I think I responded to how I felt reading the sentences and if it made sense to me at the time.,Male,White,
72,condition1,35,Hispanic,,Female,other_race,
88,condition1,27,Non-Hispanic,"Mostly I was going by feel, but I'm also aware of why I feel like some of the sentences sounded weird. If you're going to add an ""in fact"" statement, you have to expand upon the initial idea so the second verb inherently needs to be more extreme/definitive/specific than the first one.",Female,White,
77,condition1,66,Non-Hispanic,I used my gut feeling.,Female,White,
83,condition1,35,Non-Hispanic,Many of these I second guessed myself so I'm sure my first choice was the correct answer.,Female,White,
80,condition1,29,Non-Hispanic,Places of affected vs cause,Male,White,
108,condition1,36,Hispanic,All of these sentences were structured so strangely.,Female,White,
70,condition1,62,Non-Hispanic,well affect is a verb and effect is a noun so i did my best to decipher this crap,Male,White,
79,condition1,31,Non-Hispanic,,Male,Black/African American,
106,condition1,32,Non-Hispanic,None,Female,White,
114,condition1,19,Hispanic,"I realize that I had a hierarchy least to most sway where it was 1. Caused, 2.Enabled, and 3. Affected. So a sentence could be 3 then 1 or 2, or 2 then 1 and sound fine but it couldn't be 1 then 2 or 3 or 2 then 3.",Non-binary,other_race,
103,condition1,31,Non-Hispanic,"I tried to see if it made sense as I read it. After awhile I started getting confused, words sounded different than usual.",Female,White,
60,condition1,26,Hispanic,"Sometimes it was hard to keep track of the constituents, so if it made it harder I thought it was a lot less acceptable. There was also cases where it seemed redundant so I also marked those as less acceptable.",Male,other_race,

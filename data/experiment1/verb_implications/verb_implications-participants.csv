118,condition1,40,Non-Hispanic,"Any sentence which says something caused another thing, but didn't affect it, makes no sense.  If you cause something, that is an effect, so you affected it.  It is possible to affect something without causing it, like dry weather affecting wildfires by making them more likely, but it doesn't cause the fire (doesn't actually light the spark).",Female,White,
170,condition1,45,Non-Hispanic,"The main factor that influenced my response was how ""affected"", ""enabled"", or ""caused"" was used in the sentence to determine whether it made sense. For example, the sentence ""The dry weather caused the wild fire, but it didn't affect it."" doesn't make sense because if it caused it, one can assume that it most likely affected it as well.

I also kept in mind other factors, just because something enabled something, doesn't mean it was necessarily the original cause (e.g. an arsonist versus a wildfire).

143,condition1,49,Non-Hispanic,"Some of the sentences had combinations that didn't make sense as in to say something was caused by but not affected by it.

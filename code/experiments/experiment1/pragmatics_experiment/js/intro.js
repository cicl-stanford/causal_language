        <p>In this study we are interested in how you understand the words "caused", "enabled", and "affected". We will present you with a series of sentences that use those words, and we will ask you to rate how "acceptable" you feel the sentence is. We are interested in your intuitions about whether the sentence sounds natural. Sentences that sound good to you should receive higher ratings and sentences that sound bad should receive lower ratings.</p>
         </div>
         <div style="text-align:center; padding 20px; max-width:900px"><p>To give you an idea of the types of sentences you will see, two examples are provided below:</p>
         <div style="text-align:center; padding 10px; max-width:1100px; font-size: 30px">
            <p>The collapse of Lehman Brothers affected the financial crisis, in fact it caused it.</p>
            <p>The zoning restrictions enabled the housing shortage, in fact they affected it.</p>
         </div>
         <div style="text-align:justify; padding:20px; max-width:900px;"><p>We are interested in your intuitive sense of what sounds good and what sounds bad. We will ask you to complete ratings for 66 sentences overall.</p></div>
